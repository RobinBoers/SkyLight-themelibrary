# Theme: Red Blogging

This theme is inspired by a website I build years ago, when I was learning HTML. It is as basic as possible, but not too basic. I still liked the website, and I decided to build a theme for my Website Builder out of it. This is also the first official theme for SkyLight Website Builder.
